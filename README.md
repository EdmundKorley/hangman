# hangman
A simple implementation of the hangman game.

This project is essentially a collection of HTML, CSS, and JS files and to build this project you just need a static files server. It can be any of your choosing but I recommend and show instructions for Python's built-in HTTP server.

First make sure you have Python installed and are in the root of the Hangman directory:

```shell
$ python --version
Python 2.7.x
$ pwd
/path/to/hangman
```

Spin up a local HTTP server on port 8000 (or another of your choosing):

```shell
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Visit http://localhost:8000 or http://127.0.0.1:8000!
